            The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been many different
            versions of HTML. The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which became an official
            standard in December 1999.
    
            Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language. XML is a standard markup language that is used
            to create other markup languages. Hundreds of XML languages are in use today, including GML (Geography Markup
            Language), MathML, MusicML, and RSS (Really Simple Syndication). Since each of these languages was written in a
            common language (XML), their content can easily be shared across applications. This makes XML potentially very
            powerful, and it's no surprise that the W3C would create an XML version of HTML (again, called XHTML). XHTML
            became an official standard in 2000, and was updated in 2002. XHTML is very similar to HTML, but has stricter
            rules. Strict rules are necessary for all XML languages, because without it, interoperability between
            applications would be impossible. You'll learn more about the differences between HTML and XHTML in
