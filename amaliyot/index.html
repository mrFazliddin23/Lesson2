    <h3>We have Medicare Plan Options for you!</h3>

    <p>
        The way Medicare plans are alphabetized from A to D  one might be fooled into thinking that there are but a
        few options to consider.
        But deciding which Medicare coverage is right for you is definitely not as easy as a multiple-choice question
        with a single right answer.
        Medicare was designed with the idea that the vast majority of Americans would eventually receive a uniform level
        of coverage and care once they became eligible. And recipients do receive a basic level of coverage. But that
        basic level also has some gaps, including a lack of coverage for prescription drugs, dental care, and vision
        care, and the lack of a cap on out-of-pocket costs.
